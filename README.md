# Google Cybersecurity Certificate course
This repository contains all of the documentation and assignments I am completing for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate course on Coursera. 
The course covers a wide range of cybersecurity topics, including:
Risk management
Threat analysis
Network security
Incident response
Linux and SQL
Assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
Detection and response
Automating cybersecurity tasks with Python
The assignments in this repository are designed to help me gain hands-on experience with the concepts I am learning in the course. I am also using this repository to document my progress and learning.

If you are interested in learning more about cybersecurity, I encourage you to check out the Google Cybersecurity Certificate course on Coursera. It is a great resource for anyone who wants to start a career in cybersecurity or learn more about how to protect themselves and their organizations from cyber threats.

Additional information:
This repository is still under development, but I will be adding new documentation and assignments as I progress through the course.
I am open to feedback and contributions from others. If you have any suggestions or questions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
I hope this description is helpful!
