## Google Cybersecurity Certificate Documentation and Assignments

This repository contains all of the documentation and assignments I am completing for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate course on Coursera. The course covers a wide range of cybersecurity topics, including:

* Risk management
* Threat analysis
* Network security
* Incident response
* Linux and SQL
* Assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
* Detection and response
